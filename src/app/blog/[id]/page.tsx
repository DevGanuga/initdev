      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a critical step in any startup's journey. At InitDev, we've refined our process over 127 successful product launches to deliver production-ready MVPs in just 4 weeks. Here's our exact roadmap.</p>
      
      <h2>Week 1: Discovery & Architecture</h2>
      <p>The first week is all about understanding your vision and making critical technical decisions that will impact the entire project.</p>
      
      <h3>Day 1-2: Requirements Gathering</h3>
      <p>We start with intensive discovery sessions to understand your business goals, target users, and core features. This isn't about building everything â€“ it's about identifying the minimum set of features that will validate your hypothesis.</p>
      
      <h3>Day 3-4: Technical Architecture</h3>
      <p>Based on your requirements, we design the technical architecture. This includes choosing the tech stack, designing the database schema, and planning the infrastructure.</p>
      
      <h3>Day 5: Project Setup</h3>
      <p>We set up the development environment, CI/CD pipelines, and project structure. By the end of week 1, we have a deployable skeleton of your application.</p>
      
      <h2>Week 2-3: Core Development</h2>
      <p>This is where the magic happens. Our senior engineers work in parallel to build your MVP's core features.</p>
      
      <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
      <p>We build responsive, user-friendly interfaces using React/Next.js. Every component is designed with scalability in mind.</p>
      
      <h3>Backend Development</h3>
      <p>Our backend team builds robust APIs, implements business logic, and ensures data integrity. We use Node.js or Python depending on your specific needs.</p>
      
      <h3>Daily Deployments</h3>
      <p>We deploy daily to a staging environment. You can see progress in real-time and provide feedback continuously.</p>
      
      <h2>Week 4: Polish & Launch</h2>
      <p>The final week is about turning a functional product into a polished, production-ready application.</p>
      
      <h3>Testing & Quality Assurance</h3>
      <p>We conduct thorough testing including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing. Every critical path is tested multiple times.</p>
      
      <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
      <p>We optimize load times, implement caching, and ensure your application can handle your expected user load.</p>
      
      <h3>Launch Preparation</h3>
      <p>We set up production infrastructure, configure monitoring and analytics, and create documentation. Your MVP is ready to meet real users.</p>
      
      <h2>The InitDev Advantage</h2>
      <p>What makes our 4-week MVP process different?</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Senior Engineers Only:</strong> No junior developers learning on your dime</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Execution:</strong> Multiple engineers working simultaneously</li>
        <li><strong>Battle-Tested Process:</strong> Refined over 127 successful launches</li>
        <li><strong>Production-Ready:</strong> Not a prototype, but a scalable foundation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Building an MVP in 4 weeks isn't easy, but with the right team and process, it's absolutely achievable. At InitDev, we've proven this time and time again. Ready to build your MVP? Let's talk.</p>
