## **ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Announcement Bar Refinements** âœ…
- **Reduced height** to 40px for subtlety
- **Fixed positioning** at the very top (z-index: 60)
- **Smooth gradient** from blue to purple with 95% opacity
- **Backdrop blur** for glass effect
- **Refined animations** - slides down smoothly

- **Proper z-indexing** - sits below announcement (z-index: 20)
- **Smooth transitions** when announcement is dismissed
- **Mobile menu positioning** accounts for announcement height
- **No overlap** - clean separation between components

### **3. Content Spacing** âœ…
- **Main content padding** - dynamically calculated: `calc(var(--announcement-height) + 72px)`
- **Scroll progress bar** - positioned below both announcement and nav
- **Hero section** - no longer needs manual padding
- **Smooth reflow** when announcement is dismissed

### **4. Visual Improvements** âœ…

  - Compact 10px height with better typography
  - Subtle gradient background
  - Glass morphism with backdrop blur
  - Refined border (white/10 opacity)

  - Subtle hover state
  - Arrow icon for direction
- **Dismiss button**:
  - Smaller X icon (3.5px)
  - Smooth hover/tap animations
  - Remembers dismissal state

### **5. Animation Polish** âœ…
- **Entry animation**: Slides down from top with fade
- **Exit animation**: Slides up smoothly
- **Easing curve**: `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]` for natural motion
- **Duration**: 0.4s for smooth but not slow
