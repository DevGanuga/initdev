## About Page

### Hero
**Title**: Built By Founders, For Founders

**Subtitle**: We're not consultants. We're engineers who've been in your shoes.

### Our Story
**Title**: The InitDev Story

**Content**: 
We started InitDev because we were tired of watching brilliant ideas fail due to poor technical execution. 

Having built, scaled, and sold our own startups, we knew there was a better way. A way where founders could access senior technical talent without giving up equity or hiring full-time CTOs they can't afford.

We've raised funding. We've hit product-market fit. We've navigated acquisitions. We've made the mistakes so you don't have to.

Now, we're here to be the technical co-founders you need, without the equity you can't afford to give.

### Our Philosophy
**Title**: How We Think

**Principles**:

**Validate First**: Don't build what nobody wants. Test fast, fail cheap, succeed early.

**Ship Daily**: Progress you can see every day. No black boxes, no surprises.

**Scale Smart**: Build for today, architect for tomorrow. Technical debt kills empires.

**Measure Everything**: Data drives decisions. Opinions are expensive.

**No BS**: Straight talk. Real timelines. Honest challenges.

### Our Manifesto
**Title**: The InitDev Manifesto

**Points**:
- We believe innovation happens in code, not in PowerPoints
- We believe the best documentation is working software
- We believe technical debt is just debt â€“ and debt kills empires
- We believe speed and quality aren't mutually exclusive
- We believe your success is our success
- We believe in shipping fast, scaling smart, and winning markets
