## About InitDev

### Built By Founders, For Founders

We've been in your shoes. We've built startups from scratch, hit product-market fit, raised funding, and navigated acquisitions. We know what matters and what doesn't.

**InitDev is your unfair advantage.**

We're a collective of senior engineers with deep expertise across the entire technical stack: full-stack development, B2B automation, cybersecurity, AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, and data engineering. One team, multiple disciplines, zero handoffs.

### Our Philosophy: Validate. Ship. Iterate.

**VALIDATE** - Test your hypothesis with real code, real users, real data. We build MVPs that answer the critical question: will people pay for this?

**SHIP** - Launch in weeks, not quarters. Daily deployments, weekly features, monthly pivots if needed. Speed is your competitive advantage.

**ITERATE** - Product-market fit isn't a destination, it's a process. We measure, learn, and evolve based on what your users actually do, not what they say.

### The InitDev Difference

**Multi-Disciplinary Expertise** - Full-stack dev, B2B automation, cybersecurity, AI/ML, data engineering – one team, no silos.

**Startup DNA** - We've built and sold startups. We know what investors look for and what customers pay for.

**4-Week MVPs** - From idea to launched product with real users. Most agencies are still in discovery.

**Product-Market Fit Focus** - We don't just build; we measure, iterate, and optimize for actual market validation.
